# 🤖 Machine Learning Portfolio

## 👋 Introduction
This repository is a **student portfolio showcasing various Machine Learning projects** that demonstrate practical skills in solving real-world problems.  
The projects include tasks such as:

- **Data preprocessing and feature engineering**: Cleaning datasets, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features.  
- **Supervised learning**: Implementing regression and classification algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.  
- **Unsupervised learning**: Applying clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA) to discover patterns in data.  
- **Model evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.  
- **Visualization and insights**: Generating plots, charts, and dashboards to communicate results effectively.  

This portfolio highlights my ability to take a dataset from **raw data to actionable insights**, prepare it for machine learning, implement models, evaluate their performance, and visualize the outcomes in a clear and professional manner.
